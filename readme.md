### What is Player Two?

Player Two is a Meteor app that lets players and their gamemasters simplify the job of health and combat status management.  

### But you want a little more, right?

Okay, let us back up a bit. Player 2 is a web app that allows for tabletop roleplaying players and their gamemasters to track the party's health and related attributes. This means no more asking "How many hits do you have left in you?" or "When is it my turn?". It means the GM can see, right on their phone, tablet, or laptop, how the party is doing as well as tracking the various NPCs in a fight. It also means that if one player isn't able to make it to the table that week and is forced to play via remote(such as skype) they can still feel a part of the action.

### License and Copyright

Player Two is still in early Alpha, but when its complete it will be released under the GNU General Public License v3. Until then, just wait, okay?
